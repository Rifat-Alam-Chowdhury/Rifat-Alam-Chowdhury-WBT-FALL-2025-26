                <br>
                This project focuses on predicting crop yields using machine learning algorithms. It utilizes various
                datasets, including weather data, historical crop yields, to train models that can
                forecast future yields for a certain district and month in Bangladesh. The system was developed using
                <strong>Python</strong> and incorporates libraries
                such as <strong>TensorFlow</strong> and <strong>scikit-learn</strong>.
